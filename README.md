<i> Using GRAKN.AI and the Paradise Papers Leak dataset from the ICIJ </i>

In this repository we follow the common steps in modeling, migrating, and exploring highly conected data observations using `GRAKN` and `GRAQL` the query language. Although the software has originally been developed for bioinformatics; there are a wide range of use cases that can be tackled, problems that can be solved, and questions can be ansewered using the stack of GRAKN.AI tools. My background is in Law and Economics so in this repostiroy I will be trying to visualize and answer some common questions that can be conducted with regards to the Paradise Papers Leak dataset and the general nature of Tax Evasion of corporate elite.
